# Monkeypox and Covid-19 Website 🌏

#Description💡:

Due to the recent surges in monkeypox cases, in order to make the process of spreading information more efficient, we decided to create a website that allows for users to track the recent covid and monkeypox notices. When the user visits the website, they will be able to view the choropleth map, data tables, harts, and recent news regarding the topic of monkeypox and covid-19

#Languages & Packages/Library/Database/Frameworks used 👷‍♂️:

While creating this website, we mainly focused on using HTML/CSS along with some JavaScript to retrieve data online. We also utilized some JavaScript libraries such as Chart.js and D3 to produce our graphs, and data tables. Along with these JavaScript Libraries, we also utilized Bootstrap framework in order customize our webpage. 

#Challenges we ran into🕸:

For most of us this was our first time dealing with data. So, we had to spend some time researching how to retrieve data from the data provided online. We also had an issue formatting a ton of json data to get fetched for our graphs as we were unfamiliar with how node.js works so we had some problem connecting outside data with the code that we have. Lastly, one of our goal was to make our website interactive and up-to-date but we all have never tried using API to get live data from API servers so we also struggled with making live data on most of our graphs.

#If we had more time, what other features would we want to add🔮:

If we had more time, we would like to utilize APIs in order to provide even more accurate and up-to-date data to the users in real-time. We would also like the website to be more interactive and hopefully add a features for user's to chat with each other through this website regarding the topic on monkeypox and covid-19.

#What we learned🧠:

We become more comfortable with using Bootstrap formats, along with extracting data from csv files to be displayed on a graph using chart.js. We definitely got better at researching on topics that we are unfamiliar with which we all felt is a really important skills. Lastly, we learned how to use GitHub to collaborate with each other and became more familiar with some git terminal commands along with approving each other's pull requests and looking over each other's code to ensure that we are all on the same page. 

#Accomplishments🏆:

• Utilize Chart.js to make a bar graph that included the recent monkeypox and covid-19 cases

• Grew accustomed to how each team members work and quickly familiarize ourselves with what our strengths and weaknesses are 

• Converted CSV and JSON data

• Used embed code to display on site

• Joined our first hackathon

• Completed our project to our satisfaction
